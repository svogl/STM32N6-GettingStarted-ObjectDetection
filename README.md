# __Object Detection Getting Started__

---

This project provides a real-time embedded environment for STM32N6 microcontroller to execute [STEdgeAI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html) generated models, specifically targeting the object detection application. The code prioritizes clarity and understandability over performance, making it an ideal starting point for further development.

![Image sample](_htmresc/sample.PNG)
Detected classes and confidence level are displayed on the bounding boxes.

This is a standalone project that can be deployed directly to hardware. It is also integrated into the [ST ModelZoo repository](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services), and is required to deploy the object detection use case. The ModelZoo enables you to train, evaluate, and automatically deploy any supported model. If you wish to use this project as part of the ModelZoo, please refer to the [Quickstart using stm32ai-modelzoo-services](#quickstart-using-stm32ai-modelzoo-services) section for instructions.

This README provides an overview of the application. Additional documentation is available in the [Doc](./Doc/) folder.

## Boot Modes

The STM32N6 series does not have internal flash memory. To retain firmware after a reboot, program it into the external flash. Alternatively, you can load firmware directly into SRAM (development mode), but note that the program will be lost if the board is powered off in this mode.

Development Mode: used for loading firmware into RAM during a debug session or for programming firmware into external flash.

Boot from Flash: used to boot firmware from external flash.

---

### How to Program Hex Files on STM32N6570-DK Using Command Line

Ensure the STM32CubeProgrammer `bin` folder is in your PATH.

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/STM32N6570-DK/STM32N6570-DK_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex
```

---

### How to Program Hex Files on NUCLEO-N657X0-Q Using Command Line

Ensure the STM32CubeProgrammer `bin` folder is in your PATH.

```bash
export NUEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX25UM51245G_STM32N6570-NUCLEO.stldr"

# USB/UVC
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w Binary/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q/USB-UVC-Display/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection-uvc.hex

```

---

## Quickstart using Source Code

Before building and running the application, you must program `Model/<board_name>/network_data.hex` (model weights and biases). This only needs to be done once unless you change the AI model. See [Quickstart using prebuilt binaries](#quickstart-using-prebuilt-binaries) for details.

For more information about boot modes, see [Boot Overview](Doc/Boot-Overview.md).

__Note__: To select the NUCLEO-N657X0-Q display interface, use the appropriate build configuration in CubeIDE, or specify `SCR_LIB_SCREEN_ITF=UVCL` or `SCR_LIB_SCREEN_ITF=SPI` as a Makefile option (default is UVCL).

---

### Application Build and Run - Dev Mode

Set your board to [development mode](#boot-modes).

#### STM32CubeIDE

Double-click `Application/<board_name>/STM32CubeIDE/.project` to open the project in STM32CubeIDE. Build and run the project.

#### Makefile

Navigate to `Application/<board_name>/` and run the following commands (ensure required tools are in your PATH):

1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    make -j8
    ```
2. Start a GDB server connected to the STM32 target:
    ```bash
    ST-LINK_gdbserver -p 61234 -l 1 -d -s -cp <path-to-stm32cubeprogramer-bin-dir> -m 1 -g
    ```
3. In a separate terminal, launch a GDB session to load the firmware:
    ```bash
    $ arm-none-eabi-gdb build/Application/<board_name>/Project.elf
    (gdb) target remote :61234
    (gdb) monitor reset
    (gdb) load
    (gdb) continue
    ```

```

#### Program the Firmware in the External Flash

After building the application, you must sign the binary file:

```bash
STM32_SigningTool_CLI -bin build/Application/<board_name>/Project.bin -nk -t ssbl -hv 2.3 -o build/Application/<board_name>/Project_sign.bin
```

Program the signed binary at address `0x70100000`, as well as the FSBL and network parameters.

On STM32N6570-DK:

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

# First Stage Boot Loader
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w FSBL/ai_fsbl.hex

# Adjust build path as needed
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w build/Application/STM32N6570-DK/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000

# Network parameters
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Model/STM32N6570-DK/network_data.hex
```

On NUCLEO-N657X0-Q:

```bash
export NUEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX25UM51245G_STM32N6570-NUCLEO.stldr"

# First Stage Boot Loader
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w FSBL/ai_fsbl.hex

# Adjust build path as needed
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w build/Application/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000

# Network parameters
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w Model/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q/network_data.hex
```

__Note__: Only the application binary needs to be programmed if `fsbl` and `network_data.hex` have already been programmed.

Set your board to [boot from flash](#boot-modes) mode and power cycle to boot from external flash.
