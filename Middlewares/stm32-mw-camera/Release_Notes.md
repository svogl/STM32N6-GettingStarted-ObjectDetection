# Release Notes for STM32 Camera Middleware

## Purpose

The Camera Middleware serves as an intermediary layer between camera sensor drivers and user applications.
It provides a streamlined interface for initializing sensors, configuring camera pipelines, and managing data streaming.
This middleware simplifies the development process for applications that require camera functionality by abstracting hardware-specific details.

## Key Features

- Support for the STM32N6570-DK board only
- Support for the following cameras:
  - MB1854B IMX335 Camera module
  - ST VD66GY Camera module
  - ST VD55G1 Camera module
  - ST STEVAL-1943-MC1 Camera module
  - OV5640 Camera module
- Use ISP Library for ST VD66GY.
- Use ISP Library for IMX335.
- Use ISP Library for ST VD1943.
- Enable APIs to Init and Start camera pipelines with CSI-DCMIPP.
